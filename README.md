# Vadoar-W5H-Framework
An ICO disclosure and communication framework

The vision for VADOAR is to create a community based standard for ICOs.

The VADOAR W5H Framework and its related guidance notes, products and services were created to provide a foundation for standardizing the information and practices related to blockchain community building token projects (ICOs).

Many of the ICOs that have launched, and raised significant funds, have been little more than a website and a whitepaper.  Most have only a vague roadmap of their plan going forward.  The majority have no budget, no milestones and lack simple language communication describing the project and the proposed use of funds raised from the community.

If ICO Projects continue this way, it will not end well.  There will be projects that fail.  Token holders will lose the value they contributed to the project.  Some of these failures will be the tried and failed kind, but others will be the “took the money and ran kind”.  And when, yes when, that happens, the fall out may overshadow the promising potential of blockchain applications.  
If you are planning an ICO, you need to read this document. 

Community participation expresses support for your Project.  Support your community by providing a level of information about the Project that will allow community members to make an informed decision about whether to become and remain a member of your Project community.

If you have questions, or need help to create your ICO documentation, reach out to us.
